# planetaria
Newtonian N-body simulator in Javascript/HTML5

This simulator includes two classes of objects, particles and bodies. While particles move the bodies may not. It uses [leapfrog integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leapfrog_integration) to calculate motion. Particles do also interact.

To improve accuracy at the cost of speed lower dt.
